          <p>Q: Is there any fee to sign up and use Rhovit?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Nope. You can surf around the site all you want. You only pay if you buy something.</p>
          <p>Q: Why should I buy something on Rhovit as opposed to another site?</p>
          <p> <span class="rojito">A:</span> Since Rhovit doesn't take a percentage the content provider is getting wayyyyy more of your money then on some other sites. It's a nice thing to do and we suspect you're a nice person.</p>
          <p>Q: What is Dwolla and do I need an account to buy something?</p> <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Dwolla is a payment system much like PAYPAL that works like cash where the money comes directly from your bank account. If you don't have an account you can always check out as a guest. Transaction fees are FREE under $10 and only $0.25 for anything over no matter how much! We think that's pretty awesome!</p>
          <p>Q: What if I want to use my credit card?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> It's quick and easy to sign up with Google Wallet - once you have an account you will be able to make purchases with any credit card you want! (As long as it's yours)</p>
          <p>Q: I bought something and I see a download button on the page. Now what?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Right Click on Download. (On laptops - hold down control and click) Choose Save Asâ€¦From there you can save it to wherever you want on your computer. You might also want to rename the file but remember to keep the mp3/pdf/mp4 extension!<br />
            Once it's saved you can move it to any library - such as iTunes that accepts that file type.<br />
          If you just click on download and get taken to a white screen you can follow the directions above and Right Click on that screen.</p>
          <p>Q: Will there be a Rhovit App where I can save all my purchases?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Yes it's coming. We're working our fingers to the bone, so just sit tight. It'll be worth the wait!</p>
          <p>Q: Yesterday I saw an item under The Gratis but today it's gone?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Content Providers can set their products to be offered for free for 1 day, 3 days or indefinitely. If you see it and want it best to scoop it up!</p>
          <p>Q: Why does my video keep stopping?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> It may be due to buffering. The better internet connection you have the better the videos will stream.</p>
          <p>Q: Do I have to wait until my movie/TV show downloads to start watching it?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Not at all. For films you can begin watching them instantly from the promotional video window. If you bought an individual TV show just click on the &quot;Show Details&quot; button next to the episode and begin watching in the video player.</p>
          <p>Q: Can I access Rhovit outside the US?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> No. Right now Rhovit is only available to users inside the US. But if you buy something and download it, that's yours to watch and read wherever you like!<br />

          <p>THE PROVIDER Q'S</p>
          <p>Q: Why do I have to sign up for a Dwolla account to sell on Rhovit? </p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Because that's how we're going to pay you! Since we don't take a percentage but do pass back on the cost Dwolla is a great system to accept money. You can't get better then free for transactions under $10 and only $0.25 for ones over $10 isn't to bad either. So - the more Dwolla users the better! </p>
          <p>Q: Does Rhovit have any say in how much I sell my product for?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Nope. You control everything about your product. We recommend to take a look at other products like yours and use those as a gauge. Remember you make more here, so if you offer your product for slightly less than you would on another site you may sell or rent more. </p>
          <p>Q: Are there any long term contracts?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Rhovit is month to month and you can cancel at anytime. If you are paying the $9.99 to sell on Rhovit just cancel before your next month is due and you won't be charged.</p>
          <p>Q: I'm an independent provider, what does the $9.99 monthly fee cover?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> We define independent providers as those with 49 product pages or less. If that's you then you pay $9.99 a month which covers 5GB's of data. Anything over 5GB's you simply pay the cost of hosting like you would on your own site.</p>
          <p>Q: I have over 50 product pages, do I have to pay the $9.99 fee?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> No. Any provider with 50 pages or more only pays the cost of hosting.</p>
          <p>Q: Do you upcharge on any of your fees such as hosting, transaction or downloading?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Nope. What we pay is what you pay. So as we get more and more material and our prices get better your prices get better!</p>
          <p>Q: I see advertising on my product page and video. Do I get a percentage of that?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> You sure do. Depending on the amount of material you have you get 20%-50% of the advertising. Advertisers are attracted to traffic. So the more people you get to see your page the more advertising moola you can make!</p>
          <p>Q: What is The Series and how do I use it?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> The Series links products on a product page. For instance if you have a comic and it has six issues The Series is where they would all be displayed. Simply click on The Series in your backend - name it and then click on the products you want to join.</p>
          <p>Q: How does The Gratis work?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> If you want to offer a product for free you would list it under The Gratis. Scroll over the product in your provider account and click on Gratis. You will see 3 options. 1 day, 3 days or indefinitely. When something is listed in The Gratis it is brought to the front of the site, but you can only list something once a month so keep that in mind. </p>
          <p>Q: Will my product be seen on the front page of the site even though I'm an independent?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Yes. We designed Rhovit so that everyone gets seen! We have the promotional category The New which is on the main page of the site as well as each of the main category pages. Every product that is posted on Rhovit gets top listed here. We also have a list of The Cities so if you are a Chicago Filmmaker your product will get top listed in Chicago. </p>
          <p>Q: Can I post my own stuff or do I have to go through a middle man company?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Rhovit is open post. In the upper right corner you'll see The Provider Zone. Click on that - open your account and you're on your way!</p>
          <p>Q: Do I have to have a video to sell on Rhovit?</p>
          <p><span class="rojito">A:</span> Yes. We want to make this a fun experience for the users as well. Plus it's a great way for you to connect with your audience and make some extra ad dollars, especially if you make a kick butt video that everyone wants to see! So don't skimp on the video. A little work now can go a long way, so show everybody what you've got!</p>
